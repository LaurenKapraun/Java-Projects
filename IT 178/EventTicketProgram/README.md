# EventTicketProgram

This program uses the <strong>Ticket</strong> class to represent a Ticket for a concert that stores: seat location (row and column, price, and name of ticket buyer).

The <strong>Event</strong> class represents the seats at the venue and keeps track of all the seats that have been sold.

The <strong>EventSaleApplication</strong> class manages the ticket orders for each seating section for a concert venue. This class is also used to display the seats that are available and sells the tickets.

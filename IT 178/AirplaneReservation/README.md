# AirplaneReservation

This program creates a GUI application for an airplane reservation system for the GoEverywhere company.

The <strong>AirPlaneTicket</strong> class creates the layout for the Airplane Application. It also asks the user for their flight information and generates a price check, and final ticketing information.

The <strong>AirplaneDeals</strong> and <strong>FlightData</strong> classes were provided by our professor.
